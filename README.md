# The-Honored
Created using the cross-platform game engine, Unity, The Honored is a self-developed, 3D Based Game, that utilizes standard car combat features and themes based on the second world war.

## Game Objectives:
Your objective is to infiltrate a small town near Berchtesgaden, Germany in a M3a1 scout car to obtain a strong hold for the allied forces. There are going to be German scouts and tanks patrolling the city and you and your squad need to go in and take down all enemy presence in the early hours of morning. You have 10 minutes to successfully complete the mission.


## Enemies:
There are two different types of turret enemies that will be introduced to the player while playing. 

•	The first enemy turret object is German scout vehicle. This turret shoots small but quick rounds at the player invoking           minimal damage at high frequency. The scout vehicle turret is able to rotate and shoot within a given range, if player enters that range enemies start firing. 

•	The Second enemy turret object is a German Panzer tank. This turret has a larger range of visibility and fire distance. Tank fires rounds slower than the scout turret but damage upon impact is greatly increased, allowing for the player to die with less bullet impacts. Tank turret rotates towards player at all times if player is found in given fire range.

## Hazards:
#### Mines 
Mines will detonate and severely reduce player health upon contact.  
#### Oil Barrels
Oil Barrels will detonate and severely reduce player health upon any bullet contact if found near blast radius. Barrels can be detonated by the player shooting at them or if hit by enemy bullets that missed the player.  
#### Map Fog
Map Fog is the third hazard implemented allowing poor visibility which would make it harder to spot enemies and planted mines.
