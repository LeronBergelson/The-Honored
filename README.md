# The-Honored
Created using the cross-platform game engine, Unity, The Honored is a self-developed, 3D Based Game, that utilizes standard car combat features and themes based on the second world war.

# Game Objectives:
Your objective is to infiltrate a small town near Berchtesgaden, Germany in a M3a1 scout car to obtain a strong hold for the allied forces. There are going to be German scouts and tanks patrolling the city and you and your squad need to go in and take down enemy presence in the early hours of morning. Stay clear of enemy fire and complete the mission in one piece.


# Enemies:
There are two different types of turret enemies that will be introduced to the player while playing. 

•	The first enemy turret object is German scout vehicles. These turrets shoot small but quick rounds at the player invoking           minimal damage at high speeds. German soldier is able to rotate and shoot within a given range, if player enters that range enemies start firing. 

•	The Second enemy turret object is a German Panzer tank. This turret has a larger range of visibility and fire ability. Tank fires rounds slower than the scout turret but damage upon impact is greatly increased allowing for the player to die with less hits. Tank turret rotates towards player at all times if player is found in given tank fire range.

# Hazards:
•	Mines (Functionally not implemented) will detonate and severely reduce player health upon contact.  
•	Oil Barrels (Functionally not implemented) will detonate and severely reduce player or enemy health upon any bullet contact if found near blast radius.  This can either be beneficial or a severe hazard towards the player depending on strategy. Barrels can be exploded by the player shooting at them or be hit by enemy bullets that missed the player.  
•	Map Fog is the third hazard implemented allowing poor visibility which makes it harder to spot enemies and planted mines. This makes the game more challenging to play and provides a unique game experience.
